## Option 1: Download Office language interface pack (LIP)
 
An Office language interface pack (LIP) is a free add-on that changes the language of the ribbon and commands for some Microsoft Office applications, including Excel. To download an Office language interface pack (LIP), follow these steps:
 
1. Go to [this page](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/download-office-language-interface-packs-lip-5ca3dbbe-9294-0757-1c65-b7f9f99b4da5) [^1^] and select the language you want from the drop-down menu.
2. Click on the download link for the LIP you want and save the file to your computer.
3. Run the file and follow the instructions to install the LIP.
4. Restart your Microsoft Office application and select the language you want from the Language bar.

Note that an Office language interface pack (LIP) does not change the proofing tools, such as spell checker and grammar checker. You will need to install a separate language pack for that.
 
## Option 2: Download Microsoft Office 2003 Arabic
